## Result
We developed a well-crafted, functioning, user friendly, intuitive website for searching local events per your searched city. 

We incorporated server Api's that help to draw data for searching the events by city, time, location, name of the event, and added an image for each artist.
We added a fully functioning calendar which you can select a date for your event and see what Gigs are in the area.
